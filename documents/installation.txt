*** This document is still under development
	and right now it just functions as a guideline

	This installation guide is for both the simplesamlphp_idp
	and the drupalas module

	the module-specifics start at the
	"If the above is working" step



*** To make this work you need both modules installed, enabled and configured correctly:

	-drupalas module for SimpleSAMLphp
	https://github.com/masupilamie/drupalas

	-simplesamlphp_idp module for Drupal
	https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/masupilamie/2541022


*** Start by making sure SimpleSAMLphp is installed and configured correctly
	(you can skip this step if you know what you're doing)
	https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-install


*** Set up both a service provider and an identity provider
	(first make it work without these modules using the
	default SimpleSAMLphp examples)
	(you can skip this step if you know what you're doing)
	
	-SimpleSAMLphp Identity Provider
	https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-idp

	SimpleSAMLphp Service Provider
	https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-sp



*** If the above is working we have to change the session store type
	in SimpleSAMLphp

	-temporarily taken from the simplesamlphp_auth drupal module:
	(this issue also exists with the simplesamlphp_idp module
	so make sure NOT to use phpsession store.type in config.php)

	NOTE: Your SimpleSAMLphp SP must be configured to use something
	other than "phpsession" (the default) for session storage.
	The alternatives are memcache or sql.
	The sql option was added in SimpleSAMLphp version 1.7.
	The simplest solution for folks running SimpleSAMLphp
	version 1.7 or higher is to edit the SimpleSAMLphp config/config.php
	by setting
	store.type => 'sql' and 'store.sql.dsn' => 'sqlite:/path/to/sqlitedatabase.sq3'


*** Install the drupalas module in the SimpleSAMLphp identity provider installation directory under modules
	(make sure the folder is just "drupalas" (without quotes), and NOT something like drupalas-master or drupalas-source, rename if necessary)
	(the module will enable by itself)


*** Create a new authentication source in the SimpleSAMLphp identity provider's authsources.php
	The drupalas module uses custom configuration values which must be present
	See the example in documents
	(the example also contains information about the configuration options used)
	https://github.com/masupilamie/drupalas/blob/master/documents/examples/example-authsources.php.txt



*** Now on the Drupal side install the simplesamlphp_idp module
	-make sure the configuration values are correct on the module configuration page
	(admin/config/people/simplesamlphp_idp_settings)


*** From this point onwards, if the simplesamlphp_idp module for drupal is enabled,
	you will receive drupal (error) log messages about what is going wrong.
	You should definitely check the drupal log if you're stuck.



*** At this point there is a fair chance you have a working SAML IdP
	getting it's user information from Drupal.
	But if not, here are some pointers:

	-Enable the simplesamlphp_idp module in drupal and check the log
	(the log messages will only show after a saml authentication is requested)

	-is the name of the authentication source used in saml20-idp-hosted.php under 'auth'
	also available in authsources.php
	and is this authentication source configured to use the
	drupalas module for authentication?
	(like in the example: 'drupalas:default')

	-make really sure everything is working with the default SimpleSAMLphp examples

	-If you did not use the authentication source example
	and you dit not add the custom configuration options needed for this module to work
	(onfigured in authsources.php) you will never get this to work
	because the drupalas module requires special configuration parameters
	which are present in the authentication source configuration example.
