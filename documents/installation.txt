****** This document is still under development


****** This installation guide is for both:

	-drupalas module for SimpleSAMLphp
	-simplesamlphp_idp module for Drupal


****** Important notes

	Do not use phpsession for session storage in SimpleSAMLphp.
	Use sql or memcache instead.

	The SimpleSAMLphp Identity Provider must be on the same domain
	as your Drupal site.
	e.g. if your Drupal site is https://example.com
	the SimpleSAMLphp Identity Provider should be reachable through https://example.com/simplesaml/
	(Connecting SAML Service Providers can be on any domain.)

	Clean URLs must be enabled in Drupal.


****** To make this works you need both of these modules installed,
	enabled, and configured correctly:

	-drupalas module for SimpleSAMLphp
	https://github.com/masupilamie/drupalas

	-simplesamlphp_idp module for Drupal
	https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/masupilamie/2541022



****** Start of short installation overview: ******

	(more detailed installation steps can be found below)
	(this is for people who know what they are doing)

	*** SimpleSAMLphp part
	-Install SimpleSAMLphp and configure as an Identity Provider.
	-Install (copy) the drupalas module to SimpleSAMLphp IdP modules
		directory.
	-Create a new authentication source in SimpleSAMLphp and
		configure it using the example provided with the module.
		(You need to use the example because there are new
		configuration options needed.)
	-Use the newly created authentication source for the IdP.
		('auth' option in saml20-idp-hosted.php)
	-Use sql or memcache for session store
		(store.type in config.php)

	*** Drupal part
	-Install and enable simplesamlphp_idp module in drupal.
	-Configure simplesamlphp_idp module in drupal.

	*** Testing part
	-Configure a SAML Service Provider to use the just configured
		SimpleSAMLphp Identity Provider.
		(Using another SimpleSAMLphp instance configured as
		Service Provider is a good option for testing.)
	-Use the SAML service provider to check authentication.

****** Installation details


*** SimpleSAMLphp Part ***


*** Start by making sure SimpleSAMLphp is installed and configured correctly

	https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-install

	You will need two SimpleSAMLphp installations.
	(see next step)

	One configured as a SAML Identity Provider,
	this one will later contain the drupalas module which will use drupal
	as authentication source.
	(this one is required)

	And one configured as a SAML Service Provider using the other SimpleSMALphp
	(the one configured an a SAML Identity Provider) as authentication source.
	(This one is optional, but without a SAML Service Provider it's hard to test
	if the SAML Identity Provider is working.)


*** Set up both the Identity Provider and Service Provider
	
	First make it work without these modules using the
	default SimpleSAMLphp examples.
	
	-SimpleSAMLphp Identity Provider
	https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-idp

	SimpleSAMLphp Service Provider
	https://simplesamlphp.org/docs/stable/simplesamlphp-sp


*** If the above is working we have to change the session store type
	in SimpleSAMLphp

	The below text is taken from the simplesamlphp_auth Drupal module
	(this issue also exists with the simplesamlphp_idp module
	so make sure NOT to use phpsession store.type in config.php):

	" Your SimpleSAMLphp must be configured to use something
	other than "phpsession" (the default) for session storage.
	The alternatives are memcache or sql.
	The sql option was added in SimpleSAMLphp version 1.7.
	The simplest solution for folks running SimpleSAMLphp
	version 1.7 or higher is to edit the SimpleSAMLphp config/config.php
	by setting
	store.type => 'sql' and 'store.sql.dsn' => 'sqlite:/path/to/sqlitedatabase.sq3' "

	Do this for both the Identity Provider and Service Provider


*** Install the drupalas module by copying it to the SimpleSAMLphp Identity Provider's
	modules directory.

	Make sure the drupalas module is called drupalas
	not drupalas-master, drupalas-source or something else,
	just drupalas.

	This module will enable by itself.


*** Create a new authentication source in the SimpleSAMLphp identity provider's
	authsources.php

	The drupalas module uses custom configuration values which must be present,
	use the example provided with the drupalas module and edit the configuration values
	where necessary.
	(The example also contains information about the new configuration options.)

	https://github.com/masupilamie/drupalas/blob/master/documents/examples/example-authsources.php.txt


*** Configure the SimpleSAMLphp Identity Provider to use the newly created authentication source
	for its Identity Provider.

	Make sure the name used for the authentication source is the same name used
	in the 'auth' value of the SimpleSAMLphp Identity Provider configuration.
	(This 'auth' option can be found in metadata/saml-idp-hosted.php inside the
	SimpleSAMLphp root directory.)

	The example uses "drupalas-example" (without quotes) as authentication source name,
	If you keep the example value, you just have to also put this value in saml-idp-hosted.php
	under 'auth' like:

		'auth' => 'drupalas-example',



*** Drupal part ***


*** Install the simplesamlphp_idp module onto your Drupal site.


*** Enable the simplesamlphp_idp module onto your Drupal site.


*** From this point onwards, if the simplesamlphp_idp module for Drupal is enabled,
	you will receive Drupal (error) log messages about what is going wrong.

	You should definitely check the Drupal log if you're stuck.


*** Configure the simplesamlphp_idp module

	Make sure the configuration values are correctly set on the module configuration page
	(admin/config/people/simplesamlphp_idp_settings)

	When you uninstall (or reinstall) the simplesamlphp_idp module its settings
	will be lost.



*** Testing part ***

*** Test login

	Go to the previously configured SimpleSAMLphp Service Provider website and authenticate against the previously configured SimpleSAMLphp Identity Provider.

	You should now be redirected to your Drupal site login page,
	enter your username and password.

	After a successful login you should be redirected back to the SimpleSAML Service Provider
	confirming you are now logged in.


*** Test logout

	If you are able to login, make sure that SAML SLO (single logout) is also working.

	Do this by logging out through a SAML Service Provider when a Drupal session is already authenticated,
	afterwards make sure your Drupal session is also lost.
	(A clear indication of SAML SLO not working is when you have an authenticated session
	at two SAML Service Providers using the same SAML Identity Provider and when logging
	out of one of them you remain logged in at the other)

	Also make sure logging out of Drupal directly makes you log out of all authenticated SAML
	Service Providers



*** Troubleshoot part ***

*** Hopefully you have a working SAML IdP about now, getting it's user information
	from Drupal. But if not, here are some pointers:


*** Enable the simplesamlphp_idp module in Drupal and check the log.

	Log messages will only be generated when a SAML authentication is requested,
	so you have to login using a SAML Service Provider redirecting to Drupal
	to see log messages
	
	There is a trick to let the simplesamlphp_idp module think there is
	a SMAL authentication request going on:
	go to your Drupal site's login page (e.g. https://yoursite.com/user) and add the following
	to the link and go there:
	?saml_login=true&state=1&returnTo=https://drupal.org

	So the full path would be something like:
	https://yoursite.com/user?saml_login=true&state=1&returnTo=https://drupal.org

	Keep in mind that this trick will NEVER result in a successful SAML authentication,
	it is only meant to get the simplesamlphp_idp module to generate log messages.
	(A NOSTATE error using this trick probably means you are ready to try authentication
	through a real SAML Service Provider.)


*** If you did not use or look at the authentication source example
	you will never get this to work. This is because of the drupalas module requiring
	special configuration parameters which are present in the
	authentication source configuration example.


*** Is the name of the authentication source used in metadata/saml20-idp-hosted.php
	under 'auth' also available in authsources.php?
	And is this authentication source configured to use the
	drupalas module for authentication?
	(like: 'drupalas:default')


*** Make really sure everything is working with the default SimpleSAMLphp examples first,
	then try again.
